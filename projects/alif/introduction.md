This is the companion wiki of Project Nuun, which is essentially an attempt to make stuff out this awesome platform called tiddlywiki at the level of a beginner. If you do not know about tiddlywiki, you must visit the <a href="www.tiddlywiki.com">official site</a> immediately - the rest can wait. 

Right now the content is sparse in here. This was intended as a detailed documentation of the process of this project. It still is intended for the same, only I am behind a couple of milestones. While this might be child's play for the TW Gurus, I think it might come handy for someone starting out. 

Read a basic introduction to the Interface  and an outline of method in the other files in the folder. While the interface part need no more explanation, I might expand on the method in some time soon. I want it to be something that enables someone who is absolutely new to TW5 to replicate such a project. Documentation is far and few when it comes to actual user implementations are considered wrt TW5. 

###Why do this?
Purely selfish motives. For a long time, I used to try and answer the question 'What should be an ''ideal software'''. It must be free, opensource, light, cross-platform, modular, customisable and should not chain me down to a format. TW checks for all these. Now all I want is lots and lots of usable implementations out of this. For that, more people should know about this. I do not mean just developers, normal people, with normal needs but different outlooks might produce things out of this we might not imagine otherwise. So as to let them come closer, we must suit up nicer.

Oh draconian devil!
